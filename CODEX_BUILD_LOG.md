Task:
Block 1 walking skeleton for the MindBridge Phase 1 MVP.

Prompt used:
Build a complete local mock journey from landing page to feedback, without OpenAI, Supabase, auth, database logic, package changes, or external calls.

Files changed:
Added typed mock contracts in `src/types`, mock clarity/messages/resources in `src/lib/mock`, shared layout components in `src/components/layout`, product UI components in `src/components/product`, and route pages for `/`, `/onboarding`, `/chat`, `/clarity-map`, `/resources`, `/feedback`, and `/demo`. Updated `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Commands run:
`npm run lint`
`npm run build`
`npm run dev`
`npm run start`
Local HTTP checks for `/`, `/onboarding`, `/chat`, `/clarity-map`, `/resources`, `/feedback`, and `/demo`
In-app browser walkthrough from landing to feedback

Result:
Lint passed. Build passed. `npm run dev` started and reported ready on port 3000. The built app served all requested routes with HTTP 200 through `npm run start`, and the in-app browser completed the full mock journey.

Manual review notes:
All data is local mock data. No API routes, OpenAI calls, Supabase calls, auth, database logic, analytics, or environment variables were added. Product copy preserves the boundary that MindBridge is not therapy, diagnosis, treatment, medical advice, emergency support, or a replacement for professional care. Local curl requests against the dev server timed out in this shell even though Next reported ready; production start checks succeeded.

Next step:
Block 2 can add the first server-side route contracts and placeholder safety/resource logic behind the mock UI.
